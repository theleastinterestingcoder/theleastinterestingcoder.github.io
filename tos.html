                            know either by
                            posting
                            the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. If you continue to use the

                        <p>3.7. <strong>Patent Assertion Entities.</strong> A “Patent Assertion Entity,” sometimes

                            entity’
                            or a ‘patent troll,’ is (a) any entity that derives or seeks to derive most of its revenue
                            from the
                            offensive

                            control
                            with an entity described in (a). If you are a Patent Assertion Entity or are acting on
                            behalf of, or for
                            the
                            benefit of a Patent Assertion Entity, you will not assert, or authorize, assist, encourage,

                        <p>5.2.1. When you purchase Services (each such purchase, a “Subscription”), you expressly

                            the
                            legal
                            right to use all payment methods that you provide to us.</p>
                        <p>5.2.2. All fees are stated and solely payable in U.S. Dollars, non-cancelable,
                            non-refundable, and not
                            subject to
                            setoff**, unless expressly set forth otherwise in these Terms**.</p>
                        <p>5.2.3. In the event that you fail to pay the full amount owed to us, we may limit your access
                            to the
                            Services, in

                        <p>5.3. Authorization for Recurring Payments.</p>
                        <p>5.3.1. All pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with any applicable taxes and
                            other charges
                            are
                            a
                            “Subscription Fee”). Depending on which options you choose, those fees may recur each month,
                            quarter or
                            year
                            thereafter, at the then-current rate. Please note that our fees are subject to change,
                            although we will
                            notify
                            you before we effect any change.</p>
                        <p>5.3.2. By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge that your
                            Subscription
                            has
                            recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment
                            obligations prior to
                            cancellation of your Subscription by you or Stellar. We (or our third party payment
                            processor) will
                            automatically charge you in accordance with the term of your Subscription (e.g., each month,
                            quarter, or
                            year),
                            on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription using the payment
                            information
                            you
                            have provided.</p>
                        <p>5.3.3. In the event your Subscription begins on a day not contained in a later month, your
                            payment method
                            will be
                            charged on such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started a monthly
                            Subscription on
                            January
                            31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be
                            billed on
                            that
                            date. We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable
                            fees or
                            related
                            charges.</p>
                        <p>5.3.4. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or
                            use of the
                            Services
                            or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.</p>

                        <p>5.4.1. You may cancel your Subscription at any time but please note that such cancellation
                            will only be

                            (“Admin”) is
                            responsible for the compliance of these Terms by each other member of the Group, payment of

                            transferable

                        <p>11.12. <strong>Dispute Resolution for Individuals.</strong> You and we both agree to resolve
                            disputes related
                            to your use
                            of
                            the
                            Services or these Terms (each, a “Claim”) in binding arbitration instead of court, except
                            that either
                            party
                            may
                            bring suit in court to enjoin the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>
                        <p><strong>What is arbitration?</strong></p>

                        <p>Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral person (the “arbitrator”)
                            hears each
                            party’s
                            side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding on both parties. The
                            arbitrator can
                            award
                            the
                            same relief as a court could, including monetary damages. While court review of an
                            arbitration award is
                            limited,
                            if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator’s decision, then the other party can have the
                            arbitration
                            decision enforced by a court.</p>

                        <p><strong>Can a Claim be part of a class action or similar proceeding?</strong></p>

                        <p>NO. YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART
                            OF A CLASS,
                            REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. WE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OPT OUT
                            OF
                            ARBITRATION.
                            ACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
                            PURSUE OR HAVE
                            A
                            DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED
                            ACTION.</p>

                        <p><strong>What rules apply in the arbitration?</strong></p>

                        <p>The arbitration will be conducted under the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer
                            Arbitration
                            Rules
                            (the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>How will the arbitration be conducted? How much does it cost?</strong></p>

                        <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event
                            the AAA is
                            unable
                            to
                            conduct the arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
                            governed by
                            the
                            AAA
                            Rules.</p>

                        <p>Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all filing, administration
                            and arbitrator
                            fees
                            if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if
                            we prevail in
                            the
                            arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by
                            videoconference), in San
                            Francisco,
                            California, United States or at some other location that we both agree to.</p>

                        <p><strong>How do I start an arbitration proceeding?</strong></p>

                        <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding against us, send a letter requesting arbitration and
                            describing your
                            Claim
                            to
                            founders@stellarapp.io. If we request arbitration against you we will give you notice at the
                            email address or
                            street
                            address you provided.</p>

                        <p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTING-OUT OF ARBITRATION</strong></p>

                        <p>If you don’t want to agree to arbitrate your Claims as explained above, then you can opt-out
                            of this
                            arbitration
                            agreement by notifying us of your decision in writing at founders@stellarapp.io.
                            You must

                            within 30 days of the date you first agree to these Terms or any updated Terms.</p>

                        <p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF ARBITRATION</strong></p>

                        <p>The sole jurisdiction and venue for any Claims that are not handled by arbitration will be
                            the state and
                            U.S.
                            federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both parties consent to the
                            jurisdiction of
                            such
                            courts. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND STELLAR APPS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
                            TRIAL
                            BY JURY.</p>

                        <p>This Section 11.13 only applies to Claims between us and individuals, and is governed by The
